Project 1

Contributors: Vipraja Patil and Nikhil Divekar

In this project, we create our own kernel modules on BeagleBone Green Development Board. We wrote our own device drivers for two I2C sensors TMP102 Temperature sensor and APDS-9301 Light sensor using the Grove connectors on the BeagleBone Green Development Board. Designed a concurrent software application on Linux that will interact with both User-Space andKernel-Space in addition to multiple connected devices. Wrote two different tasks to interact with these two interface to collect data, another task to log system
status information, and a last task to make decisions based on the collection of sensor data.
